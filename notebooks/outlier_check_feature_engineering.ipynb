What we also observed is that all outliers for Weight and Alcohol_drink_12m were above the upper bound, while Sleep_hours had outliers on both sides—below the lower bound and above the upper bound (also confirmed by the output above). What we weren’t initially sure about was the threshold for determining an outlier.\n",

On the other hand, sleeping more than 11 hours isn't that unusual either, but if the values go beyond 20 hours and approach 24, they could very well be reporting errors or invalid entries.\n",

        "## Nominal Features\n",
        "Some models are unable to interpret letters or words directly. To make these features usable, we must convert them into a numerical form. However, when assigning numbers to categories, we must first decide whether there is an inherent order between those categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, our original data had values for the Region feature coded as 1 for northeast, 2 for midwest, 3 for south, and 4 for west. If we leave this feature as-is, models may interpret midwest as mathematically greater than northeast, which is not meaningful. Therefore, this could be described as a nominal variable. In such cases, a better approach is to use one-hot encoding, which creates binary columns for each category.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, we would create four new columns: northeast, midwest, south, and west. If an individual is from the northeast, a 1 would be placed in the northeast column and 0s in the others. To avoid multicollinearity, we would drop one of the columns and represent someone from that dropped category (e.g., northeast) with 0s in all remaining columns. This is how we handle nominal categorical variables—those with no inherent order. Just to be clear, one-hot encoding isn't required, but it may lead to better results depending on the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Ordinal Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Take the anxiety feature, which was originally coded as 1 for daily, 2 for weekly, 3 for monthly, 4 for a few times a year, and 5 for never.\n",
        "\n",
        "This feature clearly has an order: the frequency of anxiety decreases as the value increases, which could make this ordinal. However, a potential issue is that many models will assume equal spacing between levels. For example, the difference between daily (1) and weekly (2) may be interpreted the same as the difference between monthly (3) and a few times a year (4).\n",
        "\n",
        "But in reality, the drop from daily (possibly 365 occurrences per year) to weekly (around 52) is much larger than the drop from monthly (12) to a few times a year (maybe 3 or 4). If the distances between categories are not consistent, treating this feature as purely ordinal could mislead the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, we might choose to treat it like a nominal feature by applying one-hot encoding. Similar to nominal features, one-hot encoding isn't strictly necessary for ordinal data, but it could lead to better results, especially if we're unsure about the spacing between categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Numerical Features\n",
        "\n",
        "Another consideration involves our numerical features, which may be on different scales. For instance, sleep ranges from 1 to 24 hours, while days drinking alcohol could range from 0 to 365 per year. If we apply feature reduction techniques (like PCA) or distance-based models (like k-means clustering), the alcohol variable may dominate due to its larger scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like with one-hot encoding, not standardizing numerical features isn't inherently wrong—but scaling them to the same range (e.g., using standardization or normalization) could improve model performance and lead to more balanced results."
